# Brand-Influencer Matching Algorithm Enhancement

This project focuses on enhancing the brand-influencer matching algorithm implemented in the `match_brands` function in the `cloud_functions/functions.py` file. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the matching process using data from the Firestore database.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Understanding the Algorithm

The existing brand-influencer matching algorithm is documented in the `docs/match_brands_design_document.md` file. This document provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm's logic, the steps involved in the matching process, and any underlying assumptions or constraints.

## Data Structure

The data structure and schema of the Firestore database, including the fields and relationships relevant to the matching process, are documented in the `docs/firestore_data_structure.md` file.

## Enhancements

The proposed enhancements to the matching algorithm are implemented in the `match_brands` function in the `cloud_functions/functions.py` file. The rationale behind these modifications is documented in the `docs/match_brands_design_document.md` file.

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests have been written to validate the functionality and accuracy of the enhanced matching algorithm. These tests are located in the `tests/test_match_brands.py` file. Information on how to run these tests and interpret the results is provided in the `docs/match_brands_api_documentation.md` file.

## API Documentation

The API documentation, including any changes in the input/output format of the `match_brands` function, is updated and can be found in the `docs/match_brands_api_documentation.md` file.

## Usage Guidelines

Guidelines and best practices for using the enhanced matching algorithm, including recommendations for setting up influencer and brand profiles to maximize the accuracy of the matching process, are provided in the `docs/match_brands_usage_guidelines.md` file.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

Any potential limitations or edge cases of the algorithm, as well as recommendations for future improvements, are documented in the `docs/match_brands_design_document.md` file.
