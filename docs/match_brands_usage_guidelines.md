# Match Brands Usage Guidelines

This document provides guidelines and best practices for using the enhanced `match_brands` function in the `cloud_functions/functions.py` file. The function uses an improved algorithm to match influencers with brands based on their profiles and preferences.

## Setting Up Influencer and Brand Profiles

To maximize the accuracy of the matching process, it is recommended to set up influencer and brand profiles with as much detail as possible. The more information the algorithm has, the better it can match influencers with brands.

Here are some guidelines for setting up the profiles:

- **Influencer Profiles**: Include details such as interests, audience demographics, engagement rate, and preferred collaboration types. The more specific the information, the better the matches.

- **Brand Profiles**: Include details such as target audience, brand values, and preferred influencer characteristics. The more specific the information, the better the matches.

## Using the `match_brands` Function

The `match_brands` function is located in the `cloud_functions/functions.py` file. To use the function, import it into your script and call it with the appropriate arguments.

Here is an example of how to use the function:

```python
from cloud_functions.functions import match_brands

# Assume we have a list of influencers and brands
influencers = [...]
brands = [...]

matches = match_brands(influencers, brands)
```

The `match_brands` function returns a list of matches, with each match being a tuple of an influencer and a brand.

## Running Unit Tests

Unit tests for the `match_brands` function are located in the `tests/test_match_brands.py` file. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_match_brands.py
```

The test results will be displayed in the console. If a test fails, the output will include details about the test and the reason for the failure.

## Interpreting Test Results

Each test in `tests/test_match_brands.py` is designed to validate a specific aspect of the `match_brands` function. If a test passes, it means that the function is working correctly for that aspect. If a test fails, it means that there may be a problem with the function.

When interpreting test results, pay attention to the details of any failed tests. The test name and the failure message can provide clues about what might be wrong with the function.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

While the enhanced `match_brands` function is more accurate and efficient than the previous version, it may still have limitations or edge cases that could be improved in future versions. For more information, refer to the `match_brands_design_document.md` and `match_brands_api_documentation.md` files in the `docs` directory.
