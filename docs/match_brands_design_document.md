# Match Brands Design Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the design and enhancements made to the `match_brands` function in the `cloud_functions/functions.py` file. The function uses data from the Firestore database to match influencers with brands based on their profiles and preferences.

## Existing Algorithm

The existing algorithm matches brands and influencers based on a simple comparison of their profiles. It checks for common interests and preferences and returns a match if the profiles align.

## Proposed Enhancements

The enhanced algorithm uses a more sophisticated approach to match brands and influencers. It not only checks for common interests and preferences but also considers the influence level of the influencer, the target audience of the brand, and the past performance of the influencer with similar brands.

## Data Structure and Schema

The Firestore database schema used in the `match_brands` function is documented in `docs/firestore_data_structure.md`. It includes fields for the influencer's interests, preferences, influence level, past performance, and the brand's target audience.

## Algorithm Logic

The enhanced `match_brands` algorithm works as follows:

1. Fetch the profiles of all influencers and brands from the Firestore database.
2. For each brand, find influencers with matching interests and preferences.
3. Filter the influencers based on the brand's target audience and the influencer's influence level.
4. Further filter the influencers based on their past performance with similar brands.
5. Return the matched influencers for each brand.

## Performance Considerations

The enhanced algorithm uses efficient filtering techniques to improve the speed of the matching process. It also uses caching to store the profiles of influencers and brands, reducing the number of database queries.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

The current algorithm does not consider the geographical location of the influencers and brands. This could be an area for future improvement. Additionally, the algorithm could be enhanced to consider the engagement rate of the influencers.

## Conclusion

The enhanced `match_brands` function provides a more accurate and efficient way to match influencers with brands. It considers multiple factors, including the interests and preferences of the influencers and brands, the influence level of the influencers, the target audience of the brands, and the past performance of the influencers with similar brands.
