# Match Brands API Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the `match_brands` function in the `cloud_functions/functions.py` file. This function is responsible for matching influencers with brands based on their profiles and preferences.

## Function Signature

```python
def match_brands(influencer_id: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
```

## Parameters

- `influencer_id` (str): The unique identifier of the influencer for whom we want to find matching brands.

## Return Value

The function returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a brand that matches the influencer's profile and preferences. The dictionary contains the following keys:

- `brand_id` (str): The unique identifier of the brand.
- `match_score` (float): The match score between the influencer and the brand. The score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 indicating a perfect match.

## Usage

```python
from cloud_functions.functions import match_brands

# Get matching brands for the influencer with ID 'abc123'
matching_brands = match_brands('abc123')

for brand in matching_brands:
    print(f"Brand ID: {brand['brand_id']}, Match Score: {brand['match_score']}")
```

## Error Handling

The function raises a `ValueError` if the `influencer_id` is not found in the Firestore database.

## Unit Tests

Refer to the `tests/test_match_brands.py` file for the unit tests associated with the `match_brands` function. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_match_brands.py
```
